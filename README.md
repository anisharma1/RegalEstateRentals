# RegalEstateRentals


## Description:

In this project, I've meticulously crafted a full-stack real estate rental platform from the ground up. I began by configuring the development environment, meticulously designing user registration and login pages, expertly implementing state management using Redux Toolkit, and skillfully integrating features such as Google OAuth authentication, property listing creation, and powerful search functionality. The culmination of this endeavor is a robust, fully operational platform where users can seamlessly list their properties, search for listings, and engage with one another. Finally, I've successfully deployed this application for public access, equipping both novice and experienced developers with the knowledge and expertise to create their own real estate rental platforms.

    Image uploads (for enhancing the user experience)
4. Backend Technologies:
    Express.js (as the backend framework)
    Node.js (for server-side development)
5. Database:
    MongoDB (for storing property listings and potentially user data)
6. Deployment:
